# DLCV Fall 2022

### This repository contains my homework submissions for the "Deep Learning for Computer Vision" course at National Taiwan University (NTU), taught by Frank Wang.

## Overview

### HW1
**1. Image Classification**  
- Train a CNN model from scratch  
- Try alternative models/methods (e.g., fine-tune a pre-trained model)

**2. Image Segmentation**  
- VGG16 + FCN32s (baseline model)  
- Improved model

### HW2
- **Image Generation**
  - Problem 1: GAN [face dataset - CelebA]
  - Problem 2: Diffusion models [digit dataset - MNIST-M]
    
- **Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA)**
  - Problem 3: DANN [digit dataset - MNIST-M, SVHN and USPS]

### HW3
- Problem 1: Zero-shot image classification with CLIP

- Problem 2: Image Captioning with Vision and Language Model

- Problem 3: Visualization of Attention in Image Captioning

### HW4
- Problem 1: 3D Novel View Synthesis

- Problem 2: Self-supervised Pre-training for Image Classification
